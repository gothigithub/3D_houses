## The Mission: 
Company LIDAR PLANES , Which is active in the Geospatial industy. We would like to use our data to launch a new branch in the insurrance business. So, we need you to build a solution with our data to model a house in 3D with only a home address.


## Mission objectives: 
Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in :
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib


## Must-have features:
3D lookup of houses.


Nice-to-have features:
Optimize your solution to have the result as fast as possible.
Features like the living area of the house in mÂ², how many floors, if there is a pool, the vegetation in the neighborhood, etc...
And a Better visualization.



## Learning Objectives:
- [ ]to be able to search and implement new librairies
- [ ]to be able to read and use shapefiles
- [ ]to be able to read and use geoTIFFs
- [ ]to be able to render a 3D plot
- [ ]to be able to present a final product


## How?:
Understand:
    Lidar Segmentation
    DSM
    DTM
Deliverables:
source code on the GitHub repository.


## Steps
- [X]Create the repository
- [X]Study the request (What & Why ?)
- [X]Download the maps
- [X]Canopy Height Model
- []Identify technical challenges (How ?)
- []Evaluation criterias
- []It works (no bugs in the console, no error)
- []You use Git from the start and during the entire process of the - []development (at least one push per day)
- []You convince us during the final presentation

## Pending things to do:
Readme Update "about this repository"
Mindmap procedural
Collect all TIF files & Map in "DATA" folder
...
...
Check if everything Works
...

I Hope you enjoyed my work.
Thank You For Reading!
